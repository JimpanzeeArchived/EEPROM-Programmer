# EEPROM-Programmer


Do you have an **AT28C64B EEPROM** with 64K Bytes of addresses lying around your home without a way of programming it? Most people do not. But if you do, this is the right product for you. Introducing the AT28C64B EEPROM Programmer.


### Features
- WRITE 8-bit data into any of the available 64,000 memory locations
- READ capability allows users to ensure the data is input correctly after each step
- Design to work with limited I/O pins on the Arduino and other microcontrollers
- Allow the user to monitor the writing process in real-time via Arduino Serial Line

### Description
This device incorporates the use of 2 integrated chips: the SN74HC165n and the SN74HC595n. The SN74HC59n is a Serial-In-Parallel-Out (SIPO) shift register IC that allows users to output up to eight digital outputs from a single Arduino pin. The SN74HC165n is reversed with Parallel-In-Serial-Out capability, which allows users to read 8 digital inputs from 1 Arduino pin. The device also came with the Arduino code to read, write, and monitor the data in the EEPROM without any physical input.
